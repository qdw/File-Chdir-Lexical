Put this project on github.

Test on non-Unix architectures:  Does "use Cwd" really work?

Re-enable Test::Exception stanza in tests

Un-reinvent the wheel--use someone else's abs_path.

Fix my git pre-commit hook:
    1.  "$test" does not work as a way of running an executable test file.
    2.  The hook allows commits even when the test suite fails as a result of 1.
    3.  Can git reasonably be assumed to rely on bash?
